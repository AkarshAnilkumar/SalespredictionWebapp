# Sales Prediction Web Application

**In this repository we develop a web application which contains a ML model which predicts upcoming sales of given video game. The ML model trains a video game sales prediction model  and then use the trained model for giving sales prediction based on user inputs. We use catboost for building model**

## Tech Stack Used:
**1. Python**

**2. CatBoost Algorithm**
